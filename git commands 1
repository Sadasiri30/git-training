Now I am going to add few lines for this text file
here i am going to use few git commands to learn and work on them
ls - list sort
pwd - present working directory
Now we save this file and check with the commands ls, pwd, git add, git status, git commit.

Until now we used push command to push the data from local repo to remote/central repo
Now we are going to use pull request, to get the data from central repo to local repo.
So we are adding few lines here in the textfile, by using online UI(github.com) and fetching this text to the textfile in the local repo.
