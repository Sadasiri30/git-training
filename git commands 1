Now I am going to add few lines for this text file
here i am going to use few git commands to learn and work on them
ls - list sort
pwd - present working directory
Now we save this file and check with the commands ls, pwd, git add, git status, git commit.

Until now we used push command to push the data from local repo to remote/central repo
Now we are going to use pull request, to get the data from central repo to local repo.
So we are adding few lines here in the textfile, by using online UI(github.com) and fetching this text to the textfile in the local repo.

In the previous commit we used git pull request successfully, and puled the data from Central repo to Local repo
Now we are adding few more lines to test with git fetch and merge commands

Now we adding few lines here in local repo to learn about conflicts while pushing to central repo
When A is worked on the same file and pushed to the central repo, B is working on the same file in the Local repo and tried to push, but he failed to push. A conflict occur


Now we adding few lines here in central repo to learn about conflicts while pulling to local repo
When A is working on the same file in the central repo, B is working on the same file in the Local repo and tried to push, but he failed to push. conflict occur

Now we are going to undo the cahnges in working area
for that we use restore command. 
restore command is used to undo changes in working area and in staging area.
reset command is used to undo the commits done in local repo, if not pushed to remote.
we can use reset command in 3 ways, 1. reset --hard 2. reset --soft, 3. reset by default is mixed.



now we are going to test git revert command.

we add few lines here, add and commit them and then push them to remote repo
